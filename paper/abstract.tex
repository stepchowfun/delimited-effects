Motivated by an observed similarity between the rules by which type class constraints and algebraic effects propagate through programs in their respective formalisms, we introduce a novel language feature capable of modeling both. Our system offers a uniform treatment of algebraic effects and type classes. Building on the idea by Kiselyov and Shan of reifying terms as types and reflecting them back into terms, our system preserves coherence for local type class instances.
